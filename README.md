# ScentGraph

ScentGraph is a project for full stack course. The plan is to use React and TypeScript for the FrontEnd, Node for the backend and Neo4J graph database that uses Cypher queries.

In ScentGraph users can add and pick scents for their collections. The scents will belong to various categories, and can be described by having certain notes. The relations of scent families can be visualized in a graph form.
